# Database Design - FootballHome
In this simple database design practice, I design a database called "FootballHome" for football fans to help them look up relative football information. It could be widely used in almost all football matches related web applications or football fans forum. Some examples of entity sets are: Matches (gameDate, location, Teams), Football Team (TeamName, country, founded) and Team Players (name, height, position). 

As I am a huge fan of Inter Milan, basically the information is up to Inter Milan's for present. Sorry for that and I will build more information inside this project with the other teams.

Typical real-world constraints are like gameDate is past (we do not want to plan for future) and there should be only one head-coach for each team. 

Suppose you are a football fans. Through this application you can search relative information on your favorite team (honours, headcoach, history, etc), information on team players including retired players and past matches. You can also add or modify the information as long as they are truth and legal (using triggers to detect inputs).
